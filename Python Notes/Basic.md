**Buzzwords :**
   0. **Syntax & Semantics:** 
            Syntax: Rules for writing code (grammar)
            Semantics: Meaning of the code (logic)
    1.**Statements: ** Instructions(what you want the code to do)
    2.**Expression: **A piece of code that produces a value
    3.**Variable:**A name that stores a value
    4.**Class & Object:**
           Class: Blueprint for creating things
           Object: A thing created from the blueprint
    5.**Module / Package:**
           Module: A file with Python code you can reuse
           Package: A folder of modules
    6.**Comment:** Notes for humans.
    7.**Exception / Error:** Something went wrong while running code.
    8.**Global Variables:**Variables that are created outside of a function.Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
    9.**Local Variable:** when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
    10.
**Comment:** # ( single line)  """        """(multiline).
**Variable :** No need to mention data type.
              Camel Case:    myVariableName = "John"
              Pascal Case:   MyVariableName = "John"
              Snake Case:    my_variable_name = "John"
**Text:** Must be inside quotes " " or ' '
**Casting:** If you want to fix the data type of a variable,
                x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
                y = int(3)    # y will be 3
                z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
**Variable Game :**
         One Value to Multiple Variables:
             x = y = z = "Orange"
         Many Values to Multiple Variables:
             x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
         Unpack a Collection:
              fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
              x, y, z = fruits

**Data type:**

     Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
     python support a specific neumerical data type , **complex data type-** A built-in numeric data type used to represent numbers that have two parts:real part + imaginary part
     z = 3 + 4j

     3 → real part
     4j → imaginary part
     j means √-1 (math people write it as i, Python uses j)

**Escape Characters-**   
                   /n-
                   /t
                   /
Tuple → ()
Dictionary → {}
Set → {}
List-[]
